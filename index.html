        <h3>Project One: 🌱 Crop Disease Detection using Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect plant and crop diseases from leaf images. By training a model on agricultural datasets, the system can accurately classify healthy and diseased crops, helping farmers identify issues early. The goal is to support precision agriculture, improve crop yield, and reduce losses by providing fast and automated disease diagnosis.</p>

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Project Two: 💧 Water Quality Detection using Images </h3>
        <p>This project uses computer vision and machine learning to analyze water images for detecting quality levels. By examining features like color, clarity, and visual impurities, the system classifies water as clean or contaminated. The goal is to provide a quick, low-cost, and automated method for monitoring water quality without the need for complex lab testing.</p>
